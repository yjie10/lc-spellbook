# 🪄 LC-Spellbook: My Leetcode Notes

Welcome to my Leetcode notes!  
A collection of handwritten (typed) reflections, learnings, and occasional stuck moments.

Here you'll find my full thought process —- including mistakes, debugging, backtracking, and the final solution. I write notes for myself first, so they're verbose and honest rather than optimized for speed or brevity.

Difficulty rating is **_entirely personal_** and for reference only.  
A problem I find hard might be easy to you, and vice versa. We're all on different parts of the journey. 🐾

My goal is to deeply understand each question I do -- even if it means spending 40 minutes on a "easy-medium" or getting stuck on something technical for 20 minutes+. (Though... I might still forget it later 🙃)

Still figuring out my ideal way to balance practicing and learning. But if you're into slow, steady, reflective problem-solving, welcome aboard. ☁️

✨ Special thanks to my learning assistant a.k.a. ChatGPT for helping me untangle my thoughts into actual readable notes, including this README. 🪶

Made with ☕️ and crying over off-by-one errors.

_These are problems I've completed but didn't write full notes for -- either because they're too simple, repeated, or I didn't find them particularly insightful._
