# 🪄 LC-Spellbook: My Leetcode Notes

Welcome to my Leetcode notes!  
A collection of handwritten (typed) reflections, learnings, and occasional stuck moments.

Here you'll find my full thought process —- including mistakes, debugging, backtracking, and the final solution. I write notes for myself first, so they're verbose and honest rather than optimized for speed or brevity.

Difficulty rating is **_entirely personal_** and for reference only.  
A problem I find hard might be easy to you, and vice versa. We're all on different parts of the journey. 🐾

My goal is to deeply understand each question I do —- even if it means spending 40 minutes on a "easy-medium" or getting stuck on something technical for 20 minutes+. (Though... I might still forget it later 🙃)

Still figuring out my ideal way to balance practicing and learning. But if you're into slow, steady, reflective problem-solving, welcome aboard. ☁️

✨ Special thanks to my spellcasting assistant a.k.a. ChatGPT,
for gently herding my runaway logic with debugging hints instead of spells.  
No "here's the code," just "you're almost there, check that edge case again". 🐈‍⬛
... And for helping me untangle my thoughts into actual readable notes, including this README. 🪶

Made with ☕️ and crying over off-by-one errors.
