🔗 [Leetcode 3227 - Vowels Game in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/vowels-game-in-a-string/description/)

### Time & Space Complexity ⏳🌌

- **Time**: `O(n)` - One linear pass (early exit possible but still `O(n)` overall)
- **Space**: `O(1)` - No scaling data structure used

### Summary & Reflection 💭

- My Goodnotes are full of implementation doodles, but in hindsight... it was all just overthinking. So I'm skipping the implementation breakdown. Final solution is in the JS file.
- Got serious _brain teaser_ vibes while trying to reason it out... it _is_ a brain teaser. 😀
- **TL;DR**: Only Alice can win or lose:
  - She only loses if she has zero vowels to remove on her first turn.
  - Bob can't win. Ever.
